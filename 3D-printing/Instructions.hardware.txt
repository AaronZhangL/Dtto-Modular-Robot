These files have been designed to print with my personal printer,a Prusa i3
with a 0.4 nozzle and using ABS. I've printed all of them at a .25 mm layer
height.

The assembly of the parts is very simple, but the tricky part is how to manage
all the cables throught the arm. 

I will be creating the instrucions in this file as you ask.

The actual model is the 1.0. There will be updates soon.

There is a small model to print and simulate the big robot! 

Thanks!
