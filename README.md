# Dtto Modular Robot
Dtto Robot v1.0 , a modular self-reconfigurable robot

![alt tag](/IMAGES/1s.jpg)

The <strong>Dtto v1.0 </strong> Robot is a modular transformable robot designed to be versatile, flexible and <strong>self-reconfigurable</strong>. The idea of modular robots is that they can adopt any shape they want, by changing the position and the connection of their modules. 

This robot is aimed for <strong>research</strong> on modular self-reconfigurable robots and educational purposes. It is designed to allow multiple modules to communicate, mechanically connect and disconnect and to work collaboratively in the locomotion, self-reconfigurability and efficient movement.

The versatility of the robot will allow it, in the future, to be able to perform <strong>rescue operations</strong>, exploration of unknown environments and <strong>space exploration</strong>.

In <strong>future</strong> works, the modules will have built in camera, ultra-sound sensor, gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer… The possibilities are endless.
 
This is a part of a project that is currently being developed in the <strong>Universitat Rovira i Virgili</strong>, Tarragona (Spain).

Special thanks to my project director, Dr. Jose Luís Ramírez, and to Dr. Juan González-Gómez “Obijuan”, for their support and help everytime I needed it. 

It has been fully printed with open-source 3D printers, uses open-source hardware and has been designed entirely on FreeCad.

This robot is Inspired by the MTRAN III, by The National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan. (https://unit.aist.go.jp/is/frrg/dsysd/mtran3/index.htm)
