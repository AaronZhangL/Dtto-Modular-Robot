Hello!

First you should know that there is a 'master' module that you configure in the 'DttoType' definition (line 21 of 
v03 code). If you only have one module, this DttoType should be '0' (master). If you add more modules, you should 
program them with DttoType '1' (slave).

When they are connected, each module gets a number depending on the connection order (1,2,3...).

The bluetooth commands go to the rxData char array, and work like this:

- 1st character(rxData[0]): Char identifying the module you want to talk to. Ej. If you want to talk to module 1, 
this char should be '1'. If you want to talk to all the modules at the same time, you have to use athe char 'a' (all).

- 2nd character (rxData[1]):  This char is the action that the modules, or all modules, have to do. In the main 
loop 'void loop()' you have a switch case that, depending on the char on rxData[1], calls a function on the code. 
For example, if you want to call the test function, this char should be 't'.
    Command list 'rxData[1]' :
      - 's' start. moves all servomotors to the central position
      - 'r' run. starts snake movenent; 'rxData[2]' must indicate direction('m' or 'f')
      - 'e' escape. stops all other functions.
      - 'g' gancho (hook). Moves the hooks of the mechanical connection; 
        -'rxData[2]' must indicate which hook to move ('b' base, 'r' right face, 'l' left face)
        -'rxData[3]' must indicate which position to move the hook to ('0' center(hide), '1' and '2' couple or decouple)
      - 't' test. test the RGB LED on the modules
      - 'a' amplitude (experimental). change amplitude of the sinusoidal movement
      - 'f' fase (phase). change phase between motors of the sinusoidal movement

- 3rd, 4th,5... char: These characters are used as parameters in some functions, so you have to check in every 
function what does exactly do.

Examples of instructions:
  - 'arm' (All-Run-Male) starts snake movement in the male direction
  - 'at' (All-Test) blinks the RGB LED
  - '2gb0' (2ndmodule-Gancho(hook)-Base-0)moves the hook of the 2nd module to the central position
  - 'ae' (All-Escape) stops all functions, motors, LEDs of all motors.

Sorry for the bad commented code, I still have to fix it a LOT...
