Note: Please note that this programs have been written with the only purpose 
of testing the module capabilities.It does not pretend to be fancy or efficient 
in any way. It is designed to test my modules with an specific app on my phone,
but you can use any BT Spp tools app or terminal on the web.

Instructions:

Once programmed onto the modules (1 master, 2 master & slave), you can connect 
with the master by bluetooth (previously paired).

To talk with the master, all commands must be started by 'w'.
To talk to the slave, all commands must be started by 's'.
Every command has to end with a point '.'.
Note that you have to exit a mode before entering the next.

You can start by checking the connection with the master with the HELP command:

	wh.

If the connection is correct and the master is listening, he will tell you what 
commands is he actually able to do (possibly not updated).

You can tell him to go to the start position, where all servos are in the middle
(note that my code uses 83 degrees, it depends on how well you positioned the servo).

	ws.

It will remain in this start position until you exit this mode:

	we.

You can also try the snake feature with this command:

	wr.

Then it will ask you which direction will you go, you can try any of this:

	wm.

	wf.

if you want to pause the snake:

	wp.

you can choose the direction again or exit the mode:

	we.

There is also a manual mode where you can tell the servo what position to go:

	wm.

The format of the data is the next:

	wM180. // This tells the servo of the Male part to rotate to 180º
	wF135. // Servo Female to 135º
	wB000. // Servo Base to 0º
	wR090. // Servo Right to 90º
	wL101. // Servo Left to 101º
	wXxxx. //etc.....

To exit the manual mode, 'we.'.

If you want to talk to the slave module, you will have to change the first 'w' to an 's'.
